   How does theAuth System App work?
    
The Auth System application functions as an authentication and user management system with the primary purpose of authorizing users to access a specific application based on their license key.

### User Authentication

When a user attempts to access the application, the Auth System first authenticates the user's credentials, including their username, password, and license key. 

### License Verification

Once the user is authenticated, the system verifies the validity of their license key. If the license key is valid and matches the user's account, the user is granted access to the application.

### User Management

Auth System provides comprehensive user management functionalities for both administrators and users. Administrators can manage user accounts, licenses, and view logs of user activities. Users, on the other hand, can update their information, manage their license keys, and switch to the application.

### Logging

All activities and events within the Auth System application are logged for auditing and tracking purposes. Logs are stored both in the database and in the program directory to ensure redundancy and backup.

### Database Setup

To use the Auth System application, users need to set up the required database and configure the application to use it for storing user information, license keys, and logs. Detailed instructions for database setup can be found in the documentation.

In summary, the Auth System application serves as a robust authentication and user management solution, ensuring secure access to the associated application and providing administrators with the tools they need to manage users effectively.

For detailed usage instructions and setup guide, please refer to the documentation.
